This project involves building a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on various health indicators. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, the data is first preprocessed and standardized. 
The features are scaled using StandardScaler, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets. 
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel is trained on the training data. 
The model's accuracy is evaluated on both the training and testing sets, achieving respective accuracy scores.
Finally, the model is tested with a new input to predict whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic based on their health metrics.
